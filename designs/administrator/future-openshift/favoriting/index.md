* Dropdown sections and a horizontal separator will be used to visually distinguish favorite projects and all other projects.


## Roles list
![4](img/roles1.png)
* The roles list will load with several roles automatically favorited. These roles are commonly used and pre-favorited to bring them to the attention of the user.
* Users may set additional favorite roles by clicking the star toggle at the beginning of a row.
* The role will not change positions in the list when the star is toggled on or off.

![5](img/roles2.png)
* Users may view only their favorite roles by checking the "Show only favorites" checkbox next to the textbox filter.
* When the checkbox is selected, the toggle filters will be disabled to avoid conflicting filtering behavior.
* When the checkbox is deselected, the toggle filters should return to their previous states before the checkbox was selected.
