# Topology View
- A topology overview page will enable administrators and developers to easily visualize their applications, to mentally organize application components, and to get a better insight into the health and connections of those components.

## Use Cases
1. As a system administrator, I want to:
	- See how the components of my project(or projects) are connected together.
	- Verify that the components of my project are all present and functioning correctly.
	- See which parts of my project are connected to external components. 
1. As a developer, I want to:
	- Get quick access to information about my deployments and their component parts.
	- Easily view pod status for a given deployment and view logs.
	- Narrow my focus to a specific set of components based on label or namespace criteria.

## Design
- [The Invision prototype linked here includes designs and flows for the use cases described above.](https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/2ULBOIBJT4M#)
