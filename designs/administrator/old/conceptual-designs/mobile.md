# Mobile Integration
- Adding mobile features to OpenShift will enable developers to attach mobile applications to their OpenShift projects and easily create configs which can be used to communicate with mobile enabled services.

## Use Cases
1. As a mobile developer, I want to:
  - Create a representation of my mobile client in OpenShift
  - Add mobile enabled services to my project
  - Bind mobile enabled services to my mobile client
  - View information about my mobile applications and services
  - View details about my mobile client
    - Bound mobile services
    - SDK setup documentation
    - Mobile builds

## Design
- [The Invision prototype linked here includes designs and flows for the use cases described above.](https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/HJKR6OCTA2N#)
