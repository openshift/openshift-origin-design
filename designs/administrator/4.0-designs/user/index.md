- Users can copy the command and token by clicking the copy icon to the right of the field.
- Hovering over the button will show a tooltip "copy to clipboard" which will then change to say "copied" after the user clicks.
- This is the same behavior used on the Secrets page inside the console.
- There is a single close action available once users are finished copying.
