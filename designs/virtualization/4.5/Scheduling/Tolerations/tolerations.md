Within the VM page, Details tab, the Tolerations field is placed under the 'Scheduling and resource requirements' section.

The modal presents the same placement as Node-selector.
The differences are as follows:
- An additional 'Effect' field for each row.
- The 'Add toleration row', and not 'Add label row'.
- The 'Nodes checker' checks for expressions including the 'Effect' field, meaning node taints.
