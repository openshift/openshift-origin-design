# Expand PVC
## Use cases

### To decide whether or not to expand a PVC
- As a user I want to be alerted if I am running out of storage capacity.
- As a user I would like to have an idea when I might run out of capacity. How urgently do I need to increase capacity? How quickly is my storage being consumed?
  - Time-based metrics would be helpful. Prometheus has the ability to [predict](https://www.robustperception.io/reduce-noise-from-disk-space-alerts/) when a user may run out of disk space.
- As a user I want to see what applications are consuming the storage I have been alerted about.
  - This is a gap. To my knowledge we do not currently have a way to see what applications are using a given PVC.

### If I decide to expand a PVC
- As a user I would expect to know how long the operation will take as well as what my next steps should be.
  - This can be very time-consuming for EBS. Unsure about other providers.
- As a user I want to be able to take a snapshot or otherwise backup my PVC before expanding to ensure that I don't lose data.
  - This is not currently possible through the UI.
- As user I want to see what applications will need to be restarted after the expansion is complete. (Perhaps with the option to restart them automatically upon completion.)
  - For most providers, pods need to be restarted to expand the filesystem in order for the expanded capacity to be available. Same gap mentioned above--we currently lack a way to show what applications are consuming a PVC.
- As a user I want to be alerted when the expansion is complete so that I can restart my applications.
  - Because events are ephemeral, and because this operation may take a long time, a user may miss the event.

## Wizard flows
- While several providers support expanding PVCs, CNS is simpler from an end user perspective because it does not require pods to be restarted.
- These designs attempt to create a similar flow while allowing for the differing requirements of different providers.

### CNS
- CNS does not require pods to be restarted after the volume is expanded.

- It would be good to inform users upfront which application(s) would be affected by this change.
- Should we allow users to snapshot or otherwise backup their data before expanding? Or provide some

![cns expand create backup](https://redhat.invisionapp.com/static-signed/live-embed/126032072/287699481/1/latest/RlEYLUL7Vl8jRRzlEYnoAlEW42hm1bPlEzJCeED5KuvlE2RXpjb3lE9GJnYrfAdvMqfE1vIXOabxjVguyToSlqEHt0FAlE/CNS-expand-1.manual.png)
- If we cannot create a snapshot, we should provide instructions on how to manually create a backup.
- Better: Create the correct `oc rsync` command that the user can copy.
- Even better: Allow the user to create the backup through the UI so thy don't have to go to the CLI.

#### Expand fails
![cns expand fails](https://redhat.invisionapp.com/static-signed/live-embed/126032072/287699482/1/latest/yaBfus0voKglE7KFlEf8oZi1WMjNhQUf8RbOcuk6cJ3Ngw3mUYNdZmqqb6OdvwSkZK639O3RClEnntLHWiqc0WATwlE/CNS-expand-3.restore.png)

- If expansion fails, users should be given the information they need to restore from a backup/snapshot created on Step 1.
- Ideally there would be an action that helps them restore.
- At the least we should give them the appropriate instructions.

### Other Providers
- For providers other than CNS, pods that have the PVC mounted will need to be deleted and recreated.

- Could we use generic triggers to recreate pods automatically, if a user chose to do so?

- We should communicate at this point which applications will require new pods.
- Would we want to give users the option to take that action from this screen?
