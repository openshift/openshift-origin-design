The user enters the Networking step with an existing NIC pre-defined, set to Type (local). In this step, the 'Review and Create' button is still available to skip the rest of the steps. At this point, the user can select to customize this NIC, add new ones, or remove any they wish.

Clicking on 'Add NIC' will pop up a "Create NIC" modal. The NIC name is prepopulated with a numeric count form of existing NICs on this flow. The user may change the NIC name. All the fields are preselected except Type. In order for the user to apply and add this NIC, the user must select one of the type options.
