When `migrate` is selected the user is presented with a confirmation dialog that requires them to confirm the migrationlet and clarifies that this VM is migrated to the next most suitable node.

Once the migration has finished the 'migrating' status icon will be changed back to 'running'.

There will be no notifications for succssfully completed actions.

On error, the user will be provided with a toast notification letting them know the migration failed. This will also get reflected in the VM's status (updated to an error state) and clicking on it will show a popover with additional explanation and a link to learn more.
