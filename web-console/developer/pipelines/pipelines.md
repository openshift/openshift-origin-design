# Task Status Component
## Overview
- The task status component is  a 100% stacked bar chart (Implementation note: use PF4/Victory to remain aligned with OpenShift console strategy). 
- Last status represents the tasks of the last pipeline run.
- Each segment of the chart represents the group of tasks which are the same status.
- Task segments are in the following order: 
    - Succeeded
    - Failed
    - Cancelled
    - Skipped
    - Running
    - Pending
- Hovering over the widget will show a tooltip indicating the number of tasks in each of the task statuses
- The height of the task status component should remain constant and similar in height to associated text.
- Clicking on any part of the task status widget will navigate to the Log Tab of the pipeline run details view.
- Use a 3 px separator between segments

# Pipeline Visualization
## Overview
This visualizes all tasks associated with the pipeline.

![PL Visualization](img/PLVisualization.png)


# Pipeline Run Visualization
- This visualizes the status of the tasks and associated steps of the pipeline run.
- Tasks can be asynchronous and are represented by bubbles in the visualization
- Steps are synchronous and are represented as line segments inside the task bubbles
- In 4.2, only the tasks which have started will be able to be shown in the Pipeline Run visualization.
