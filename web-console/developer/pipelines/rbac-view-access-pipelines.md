# Pipeline experiences when user has view only access of a project#

If the user is assigned to a project with `view` access, then user will be restricted from the following actions of the project:
 - add
 - edit and
 - delete

_i.e. user cannot add, edit and delete any annotations, labels, parameter, and resources & user cannot start, stop, restart, edit and delete any pipeline tasks._

### Pipelines List View ###

When a user has view only access for a project then the kebab and all associated actions will be disabled. So that user cannot start or stop or delete any of the pipelines and pipeline Runs
